During my bachelors degree at the Technical University of Sofia I noticed that communication between staff and students is a bit sloppy. Usually there would be an email or facebook group where staff members would send information about upcomming exams, vacations, Erazmus programes and so forth. The problem with that is some students didn't receive the information due to the fact that they didn't have the password for the email or weren't in the facebook group. Another problem is that students from different study groups were cluttered in the same facebook group and email address. This way they received information they didn't need.</br>
My solution was to create a unified system, where there would be 3 types of members:</br>
<b>Administration</br>
Teachers</br>
Students</br></b>
Each of these members have different privilages on the platform.</br>
Administration creates a student account in the system upon acceptance into the university.</br>
Teachers and Administration could write posts to a specific group or to everyone, that appear on the students rimeline.</br>
Students can only see information on their News Feed regarding their study group only or messages addressed to everyone.
